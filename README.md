# My Own RESTful API

The My Own RESTful API project is a customizable and extensible API that allows developers to build and deploy their own RESTful services. It provides a foundation for creating APIs with various endpoints and functionalities.

## üåü Features

- **Customizable Endpoints**: The API allows you to define your own endpoints based on your application's specific requirements.
- **RESTful Architecture**: The API follows REST (Representational State Transfer) principles, providing a standardized and scalable approach for building web services.
- **CRUD Operations**: The API supports common CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing resources.
- **Data Persistence**: The API integrates with a MongoDB database system for persistent storage and retrieval of data.
- **Error Handling**: The API includes error handling mechanisms to provide informative and consistent error responses to clients.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The My Own RESTful API is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications.
- **EJS**: A templating engine for generating dynamic HTML pages.
- **Body-parser**: A middleware for parsing HTTP request bodies.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database management system for storing and retrieving data.
- **Mongoose**: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js that provides a more straightforward interface for interacting with the database.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the My Own RESTful API locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/MianUsamaIjaz/My-Own-RESTful-API.git

2. Set up the database:

Install and configure your preferred database system (such as MongoDB or MySQL).
Update the connection details in the application (e.g., app.js or a separate configuration file).

3. Install the dependencies:
npm install

4. Start the server:
node app.js

5. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/articles` to access the JSON.

6. You can manipulate the data with using **Postman**
